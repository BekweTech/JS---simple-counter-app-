Hello!
This is a simple counter app that increments by 1 from 0 and also saves the number displayed when you hit save. 
The count is reset to 0 when you hit save.
-Css attached as well but is very basic and simple except for the centered div lol.

If you are working on an app and needed to implement this "function" into your code then this is for you.
If you just wanted to learn about some simple js functions this also for you.

Enjoy your day if you are reading this!
